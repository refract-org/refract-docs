# Temporal Model

Refract is designed around time — not just "what is the latest version?" but
"how did this claim change across revisions?"

## Why temporal infrastructure

Most document tools answer from the present corpus. Refract answers across
time:

- **Rewind**: What did this claim say two years ago?
- **Replay**: How did this claim drift across revisions?
- **Compare**: What changed between the 2024 and 2025 guideline versions?
- **Audit**: What was supportable at the time of a specific decision?
- **Forecast**: What would trigger re-review?

A vector database can find similar claims. It cannot do any of the above.
Refract fills that gap with deterministic, provenance-backed temporal
infrastructure.

## Claim-state events

Refract emits structured events that capture how claims change over time:

| Event | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `sentence_first_seen` | Claim appeared in the source for the first time |
| `sentence_modified` | Claim wording changed (with edit magnitude) |
| `sentence_removed` | Claim removed from the source |
| `citation_added` | New supporting citation attached |
| `citation_removed` | Citation removed or superseded |
| `revert` | Edit was reverted (with cluster information) |

Each event carries deterministic enrichment fields:
- `editMagnitude` — minor / moderate / major
- `contentChange` — introduction / removal / expansion / compression / rewrite
- `directionSignal` — strengthening / weakening / neutral
- `certaintyProfile` — counts of hedging and certainty markers
- `quantitativeFindings` — extracted p-values, hazard ratios, and sample sizes

All fields are byte-reproducible. Same source, same events, every time.

## Downstream use

Refract provides the timeline. Downstream systems provide the judgment.

[NextConsensus](https://nextconsensus.com) uses Refract timelines to evaluate
whether a specific healthcare claim is still supportable for a specific use
in a specific decision context. But Refract itself remains domain-neutral —
it works on any versioned text source.
